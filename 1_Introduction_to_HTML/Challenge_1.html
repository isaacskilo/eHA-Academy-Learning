        <h1>MY MOTHER</h1>
        <P>
            <h2>Verse 1</h2>
            Who sat and watched my infant head <br>
            When sleeping on my cradle bed,<br>
            And tears of sweet affection shed?<br>
            My Mother. <br>
            <h2>Verse 2</h2>
            When pain and sickness made me cry,<br>
            Who gazed upon my heavy eye,<br>
            And wept for fear that I should die? <br>
            My Mother. <br>
            <h2>Verse 3</h2>
            Who taught my infant lips to pray <br>
            And love God's holy book and day,<br>
            And walk in wisdom's pleasant way?<br>
            My Mother. <br>

            <h2>Verse 4</h2>
            And can I ever cease to be <br>
            Affectionate and kind to thee,<br>
            Who wast so very kind to me,<br>
            My Mother?<br>
        </P>
